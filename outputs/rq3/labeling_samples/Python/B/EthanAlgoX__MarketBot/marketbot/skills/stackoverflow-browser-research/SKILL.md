# Stack Overflow Browser Research

Use this skill when the user needs developer pain-point or implementation
signal around a technology, framework, API, or product.

## Workflow

1. Use `browser_site` with Stack Overflow adapters that exist in the runtime catalog. Prefer exact adapters such as:
   - `stackoverflow/search`
   - `stackoverflow/thread`
2. Typical calls:
   - problem search: `browser_site(adapter="stackoverflow/search", args=["openai python rate limit"])`
   - thread inspection: `browser_site(adapter="stackoverflow/thread", args=["<question-url-or-id>"])`
3. Extract:
   - recurring implementation issues
   - setup or migration friction
   - whether interest looks broad or niche
4. Pair with `hackernews-browser-research` when developer discussion quality matters.

## Rules

- Do not invent undocumented `stackoverflow/*` adapters. If the runtime catalog does not expose the one you need, say so and continue with the closest listed adapter.
- Treat Stack Overflow as friction and adoption signal, not as direct business proof.
- Separate novice setup issues from structural product weakness.
